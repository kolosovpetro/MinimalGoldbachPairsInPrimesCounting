This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of the work~\cite{yamagishi2025goldbach} done by Michel Yamagishi,
extending it with additional results.
The Goldbach conjecture asserts that every even integer $2N \geq 4$ is a sum of two primes
\begin{align*}
    2N = p_i + p_j
\end{align*}
where $(p_i, p_j)$ is called a Goldbach pair.

A Goldbach pair is not unique for even integers greater than 6,
which means that there can be multiple Goldbach pairs for even integer $2N \geq 8$.
For example: $10=3+7$ and $10=5+5$ and $10=7+3$, where the Goldbach pairs are $(3,7), \; (5,5), \; (7,3)$.

The minimal Goldbach pair is the pair with the smallest $p_i$ among all goldbach pairs for even integer $2N$.
For the even integer $10$, we have three pairs: $(3,7), \; (5,5), \; (7,3)$
and the minimal one is $(3,7)$ because
$3$ is the smallest among all $p_i$ values: $3, 5, 7$.
Consider the following minimal Goldbach pairs for even integer $2k$ within the range $6 \leq 2k \leq 50$
\begin{align*}
    6  &= 3 + 3,   & 24 &= 5 + 19,  & 40 &= 3 + 37, \\
    8  &= 3 + 5,   & 26 &= 3 + 23,  & 42 &= 5 + 37, \\
    10 &= 3 + 7,   & 28 &= 5 + 23,  & 44 &= 3 + 41, \\
    12 &= 5 + 7,   & 30 &= 7 + 23,  & 46 &= 3 + 43, \\
    14 &= 3 + 11,  & 32 &= 3 + 29,  & 48 &= 5 + 43, \\
    16 &= 3 + 13,  & 34 &= 3 + 31,  & 50 &= 3 + 47, \\
    18 &= 5 + 13,  & 36 &= 5 + 31,  &             \\
    20 &= 3 + 17,  & 38 &= 7 + 31,  &             \\
    22 &= 3 + 19,  &               &
\end{align*}
We can notice that minimal Goldbach pairs with minimal $p_i=3$ produce a sequence of odd prime numbers
$p_j = 3, \; 5, \; 7, \; 11, \; 13, \; 17 \; \dots$ which is quite remarkable:
\begin{align*}
    6  &= 3 + 3,   & 32 &= 3 + 29, \\
    8  &= 3 + 5,   & 34 &= 3 + 31, \\
    10 &= 3 + 7,   & 40 &= 3 + 37, \\
    14 &= 3 + 11,  & 44 &= 3 + 41, \\
    16 &= 3 + 13,  & 46 &= 3 + 43, \\
    20 &= 3 + 17,  & 50 &= 3 + 47, \\
    22 &= 3 + 19,  &              \\
    26 &= 3 + 23,  &
\end{align*}
Another interesting observation is that by selecting the pairs with minimal $p_i=5$ yields
the sequence of primes $p_j$ such that $p_j+2$ is not a prime
\begin{align*}
    12 &= 5 + 7,   & 36 &= 5 + 31, \\
    18 &= 5 + 13,  & 42 &= 5 + 37, \\
    24 &= 5 + 19,  & 48 &= 5 + 43, \\
    28 &= 5 + 23,  &
\end{align*}
To formalize and clarify our discussion, we define a few functions.
Let $G_{\min} (2N)$ be a function that returns a set of minimal Goldbach pairs $(p_i, p_j)$ having $\min p_i$
over the range $6 \leq 2k \leq 2N$
\begin{align*}
    G_{\min} (2N) = \{(p_i, p_j) \mid p_i + p_j = 2k \mid 6 \leq 2k \leq 2N \mid \min p_i \}
\end{align*}
For example,
\begin{align*}
    G_{\min}(20) = \{
    (3,3),\;
    (3,5),\;
    (3,7),\;
    (5,7),\;
    (3,11),\;
    (3,13),\;
    (5,13),\;
    (3,17)
    \}
\end{align*}
Let $W_{2N}(P)$ be a function that returns the set of elements $p_j$ from $G_{\min} (2N)$ having $p_i=P$
\begin{align*}
    W_{2N}(P) = \{p_j \mid (p_i, p_j) \in G_{\min} (2N) \; \mathrm{and} \; p_i = P \}
\end{align*}
Then, the sequence of odd prime numbers~\cite{oeis:A065091} is given by $W_{2N}(3)$
\begin{align*}
    \{ 3, \; 5, \; 7, \; 11, \; \dots, \; p \leq 2N - 3\} = W_{2N}(3)
\end{align*}
Now we can easily count the number of primes within the interval $6 \leq 2k \leq 2N$ because $\pi(2N)$ is equal to
the total number of elements inside the set $W_{2N}(3)$, which corresponds to the sequence~\cite{oeis_A000720}
\begin{align*}
    \pi(2N) = F_{2N+3}(3) + 1
\end{align*}
where $F_{2N}(3)$ is the function that counts the number of elements inside the set $W_{2N}(3)$.
In general $F_{2N}(P) = |W_{2N}(P)|$.

Taking $P=5$ in $W_{2N}(P)$ yields a sequence of primes $p_j$ such that $p_j+2$ is not a prime~\cite{oeis:A049591}
\begin{align*}
    W_{2N}(5) = \{ 7, \; 13, \; 19, \; 23, \; 31, \; 37, \; 43, \; 47, \; 53, \; \dots, \;  p \leq 2N - 5 \}
\end{align*}
Hence, by excluding the elements of the set $W_{2N}(5)$ from the set $W_{2N}(3)$ yields the sequence of
lesser twin primes~\cite{oeis:A001359}
\begin{align*}
    W_{2N}(3) \setminus W_{2N}(5) = \{ 3, \; 5, \; 11, \; 17, \; 29, \; 41, \; 59, \; 71, \; 101, \; 107, \; 137, \; \dots, \;  p \leq 2N - 3 \}
\end{align*}
This implies that the number of twin primes in range $6 \leq 2k \leq 2N$ can be expressed in terms of $F_{2N}(P)$
\begin{align*}
    \pi_2 (2N) = F_{2N+3}(3) - F_{2N+5}(5)
\end{align*}
For example,
\begin{align*}
    \pi_2 (10) &= F_{10+3}(3) - F_{10+5}(5) = 2 \\
    \pi_2 (100) &= F_{100+3}(3) - F_{100+5}(5) = 8 \\
    \pi_2 (1000) &= F_{1000+3}(3) - F_{1000+5}(5) = 35 \\
    \pi_2 (10000) &= F_{10000+3}(3) - F_{10000+5}(5) = 205 \\
    \pi_2 (100000) &= F_{100000+3}(3) - F_{100000+5}(5) = 1224 \\
    \pi_2 (1000000) &= F_{1000000+3}(3) - F_{1000000+5}(5) = 8169
\end{align*}
These results match the sequence~\cite{oeis_A007508}.

In addition, the functions $W_{2N}(P)$ and $F_{2N}(P)$ provide a way to count cousin
primes $p$ such that $p+4$ is a prime.
We can observe this by excluding the elements of the set $W_{2N}(7)$ from the set $W_{2N}(5)$ which gives
the sequence of cousin primes~\cite{oeis:A023200}
\begin{align*}
    W_{2N}(5) \setminus W_{2N}(7) = \{ 7, \; 13, \; 19, \; 37, \; 43, \; 67, \; 79, \; 97, \; 103, \; 109, \; 127, \; 163, \; \dots, \;  p \leq 2N - 5 \}
\end{align*}
Therefore, the number of cousin primes up to $2N$ can be calculated as
\begin{align*}
    \pi_4 (2N) = F_{2N}(5) - F_{2N}(7)
\end{align*}
For instance,
\begin{align*}
    \pi_4 (10) &= F_{10}(5) - F_{10}(7) = 0 \\
    \pi_4 (100) &= F_{100}(5) - F_{100}(7) = 7 \\
    \pi_4 (1000) &= F_{1000}(5) - F_{1000}(7) = 40 \\
    \pi_4 (10000) &= F_{10000}(5) - F_{10000}(7) = 202 \\
    \pi_4 (100000) &= F_{100000}(5) - F_{100000}(7) = 1215 \\
    \pi_4 (1000000) &= F_{1000000}(5) - F_{1000000}(7) = 8143
\end{align*}
These results match the sequence~\cite{oeis:A093737}.

Having $P=7$ function $W_{2N}(P)$ yields the sequence of primes such that $p_j-p_i \geq 6$,
where $p_j$ is the next prime after $p_i$, see~\cite{oeis:A124582}
\begin{align*}
    W_{2N}(7) = \{ 23, \; 31, \;  47, \; 53, \; 61, \;  73, \; 83, \; 89, \; 113, \; \dots, \; p \leq 2N-7 \}
\end{align*}
This allows us to count the primes for which the next-prime gap at least 6: $\delta_6(2N) = F_{2N+7}(7)$.

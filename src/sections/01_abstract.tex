Assuming Goldbach's Conjecture holds, every even integer $2N \geq 4 $ can be written as $2N = p_i + p_j$
where $(p_i, p_j)$ is called a Goldbach pair.
The minimal Goldbach pair is a pair $(p_i,p_j)$ having the minimal $p_i$ such that $p_j = 2N - p_i$ is also a prime.
We define a function $F_{2N}(P)$ that counts occurrences of $p_i = P$ within the range $6 \leq 2k \leq 2N$,
where $P$ is a prime.
In particular, the function $F_{2N}(P)$ provides the following identities in terms of prime counting $\pi(2N)$ and
twin-prime counting $\pi_2(2N)$
\[
    \pi(2N) = F_{2N+3}(3) + 1, \quad \pi_2(2N) = F_{2N+3}(3) - F_{2N+5}(5)
\]
